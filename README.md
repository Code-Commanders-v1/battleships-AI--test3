Battleship Game
This repository contains a Battleship game implemented in Python. The game consists of two main components: battleship.py and server.py.

Files
battleship.py
This file implements both the client-side logic for the Battleship game and the server-side logic for handling the game state and communication between players.

Key Classes and Functions:
BattleshipServer: Handles server-side logic including connecting players, managing turns, and relaying moves between players.
BattleshipGame: Handles client-side logic including UI creation with Tkinter, ship placement, and sending/receiving moves from the server.
server.py
This file contains the server-side logic for the Battleship game. It sets up a socket server, handles player connections, and manages the game flow.

Key Classes and Functions:
BattleshipServer: This class handles setting up the server, accepting player connections, and managing the game state.
handle_client: Manages communication with a single client, relaying moves and maintaining turn order.
How to Run
Server: Run the server.py file to start the server.

sh
python server.py
Client: Run the battleship.py file to start the client.

sh
python battleship.py
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually included with Python)
Make sure to have these dependencies installed before running the game.
